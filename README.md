# Hello_World
This is a test for how to use Github

# Description about myself
I am 34, and finally admitting that I think I love to code. And, I'm just learning about Git and Github. So far, this seems great. I'm curious about how well I could use Github for the coding projects I work on in class. It would probably be a good idea to play around with using Github as the repositories for where I place all the assignments I works on. I think I'll try that!
